Utils:

	Contains utility-stuff that can stand on its own,
	but are way too small to deserve its own repo.

Contains:

	* html.php:
		
		An html-class designed to standardize the way I
		generate html in php. Use it like so:

		html::tag_name(  ); 			//Self-enclosing
		html::tag_name( data );			//Regular tag w/ data
		html::tag_name( data, attr )		//W/ attributes
		html::tag_name( data, attr, type ); 	//W/ attributes

		All parameters except type can be either 'string',
		or 'array'.

		If all three paramters is passed and type isn't 
		'html::tag_start' then 'data' and 'attr' will 
		be discarded.
